# WhO AM I? 

## Hello everyone and welcome to my world

You will find me where you never expect, where few people go and where few should be. There is no win without a champion, no champion without a fight and no fight without training.

That's why I have to consume JAVA for breakfast, DevOps for lunch and Music for dinner. Motivation, improvements, leadership and team spirit are my strength.

I will be happy to challenge any proposal that meets my expectations.

You can find my articles here on [Medium](https://medium.com/@denis.tuekam) and on my blog [Hafricker](https://hafricker.com/). 

Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-tuekam/) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/denis_tgk) to be updated on next challenges.
